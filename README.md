# A Statistical look at the NFL

## Abstract
Using statistical analysis, we analyzed NFL team and player data collected from multiple sources to investigate 4 interesting questions about performance and play factors. **Please see the report and presentation files for a more detailed explanation of the project and results.** 

### Question I:
There is no strategic reason why home field advantage should exists for NFL games where in sports like Baseball, which are turn based, the home team gets the final chance to score runs. We investigate if teams win more games at home and verify a statistical significance to a home field advantage.

##### **Conclusion: For most teams, there is a significant home field advantage when we looked at 5 year intervals of data over 41 years.**

### Question II:
Athlete pay is generally a combination of their skill and the revenue they bring in for fans coming to see them perform. We investigate, specifically, if there is a statistically significant relationship between player compensation and their performance.

##### **Conclusion: We found a strong case against there being a significant impact of ompensation on player performance.**

### Question III:
Throughout the last few decades, the NFL has updated their rules and some changes were designed to have major impacts on the game. We investigate if 2 key rule changes have had any significant impact on gameplay. Most specifically, we investigated the **encroachment** rule (a defensive penalty for "off-sides") implemented in 1995 and the rule pertaining to **roughing the passer, unnecessary roughness and horse-collar tackling** which was implemented in 2005.

##### **Conclusion: We found a significant increase in penalty yards per game following both rule changes but the most significant rule was the encroachment rule.**

### Question IV:
Using multivariate linear regression techniques, we filtered through all team features to fund the most appropriate model for predicting win percentages of NFL teams. This was an attempt to test the validity of a linear relationship between team data and win  percentages.

##### **Conclusion: We were able to construct a model with 6 highly significant features, however the model itself has limited forecasting capacity as we can seem from the variance in the residuals that the relationship is most likely non-linear.**
